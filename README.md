# Credit_Risk_Analysis
_Applying machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk._


## Overview
Credit risk presents an classification problem for supervised machine learning models, namely that good loans (one class) far outnumber the risky loans (another clas) making it difficult to train a model to detect the risky loans. Without particular attention, a supervised machine learning model will simply train itself to pick up the good loans which does a business no good. Enter stage left, our hypothetical institutional client LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.  

To assist LendingClub with its issue identifying bad loans, I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn, two python machine learning libraries, to train six supervised machine learning models based on different resampling techniques. The six different machine learning methods used were as follows: 
- ROS
- SMOTE
- Undersampling
- SMOTEENN
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble Classifer

Below in the results section, I evaluate the performance of each of these models. And, in the summary section I recommend whether the models should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
